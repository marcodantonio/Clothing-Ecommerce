                                - <strong>improved:</strong> In addition to HTML files, this theme now comes with Pug file sources, 
                                    and changes in the Gulp workflow. 
                                    Pug compilation is now the recommended way of work with this theme. Pug sources 
                                    use includes and mixins for avoid repetitive code (navbar, footer, cards).
                                    If you change the navbar, the change will be effective in all your pages, 
                                    unlike when developing with HTML, where you would need to do all the changes in every file. 

                                    <strong>changes:</strong>
                                    * <code>pages</code> folder now renamed to <code>html</code>
                                    * to run previously default `gulp` command, use `gulp dev-html`
                                    * `gulp build` and `gulp build-html` now compile everything into `build` folder,
                                        previously `dist`
                                - <strong>fixed:</strong> Display issues in cart sidebar
